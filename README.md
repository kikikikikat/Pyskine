# Pyskine

### What
Like a Mokeskine, Pyskine is my python notebook for discoveries, ideas and prototypes. Being a huge fan of visualization, you are gonna see a lot of pretty(?) pictures in this notebook.

### When
I've made a soft resolution to write something every day! However, some days I might be using Mercury days<sup>*</sup>.

### How
Each folder is an entry that contains everything needed to run the notebook. 
Go to an entry and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
